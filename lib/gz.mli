(** {1 GZIP layer.}

    GZIP is a standard on top of RFC1951 according RFC1952. It uses the {!De}
   implementation with the LZ77 compression algorithm. Module provides
   non-blocking streaming codec to {{:#decode}decode} and {{:#encode}encode}
   GZIP encoding. It can efficiently work payload by payload without blocking IO. *)

type bigstring =
  (char, Bigarray.int8_unsigned_elt, Bigarray.c_layout) Bigarray.Array1.t

(** {2:decode GZIP Decoder.}

    Unlike [de], [gz] provides a referentially transparent {!Inf.decoder}. The
   client must use a {!Inf.decoder} given {b by} {!Inf.decode} instead of a
   decoder given {b to} {!Inf.decode}. A common use of [gz] is:

    {[
      let rec go d0 = match Inf.decode d0 with
        | `Await d1 -> ... go d1
        | `Flush d1 -> ... go d1

      [gz], as [de], uses [o] buffer as internal buffer to store output. We
     recommend to allocate an {!io_buffer_size} buffer as output buffer. Then,
     {!dst_rem}[ decoder] tells you how many unused bytes remain in [o]. *)

  val decode : decoder -> signal
  (** [decode d0] is:

      {ul
      {- [`Await d1] if [d0] has a [`Manual] input source and awaits for more
     input. The client must use a {!src} with [d1] to provide it.}
      {- [`Flush d1] if given output buffer [o] (see {!decoder}) needs to be
     drained before work can be resumed. The client must use {!flush} with [d1]
     to {b completely} flush [o]. Usually [o] will be full and consist fully of
     bytes that need to be copied from the buffer, but sometimes only the first
     part of the buffer is used. In those cases {!dst_rem} will give you the
     amount of free/unused bytes remain in [o]. These should {b not} be copied
     since their contents are not part of the output. Instead, the first
     [bigstring_length o - Inf.dst_rem d1] bytes should be copied when flushing
     [o].}

      @raise Invalid_argument if the length of the given [key] is not equal to 2. *)
end

(** {2:encode GZIP Encoder.}

    GZIP encoder is glue between the LZ77 algorithm and the DEFLATE encoder,
   prefixed with a GZIP header. Any deal with compression algorithm is not
   possible on this layer (see {!De} for more details). As {!Inf}, and unlike
   {!De}, {!Gz} provides a referentially transparent encoder.

    The client must use the {!Def.encoder} given {b by} {!Def.encode} instead a
   [encoder] given {b to} {!Def.encode}. *)

module Def : sig
  type src = [ `Channel of in_channel | `String of string | `Manual ]
  (** The type for input sources. With a [`Manual] source the client must
     provide input with {!src}. With [`String] or [`Channel] source the client

     must provide output storage with {!dst}. With [`Buffer] or [`Channel]
     destination the client can safely discard [`Flush] case (with [assert
     false]). *)

  type encoder
  (** The type for GZIP encoders. *)

  type ret = [ `Await of encoder | `End of encoder | `Flush of encoder ]

  val encoder :
       src
    -> dst
    -> ?ascii:bool
    -> ?hcrc:bool
    -> ?filename:string
    -> ?comment:string
    -> mtime:int32
    -> os
    -> q:De.Queue.t
    -> w:De.Lz77.window
    -> level:int
    -> encoder
  (** [encoder src dst ~mtime os ~q ~w ~level] is an encoder that inputs from
     [src] and that outputs to [dst].

      {b Internal queue.}

      [encoder] deals internally with compression algorithm and DEFLATE encoder.
     To pass compression values to DEFLATE encoder, we need a queue [q]. Length
     of [q] has an impact on performance, and small lengths can be a bottleneck,
     leading {!encode} to emit many [`Flush]. We recommend a que as large as
     output buffer.

      {b Window.}

      GZIP needs a sliding window to operate the LZ77 compression. The window
     must be a {i 32k} window ({!De.make_window} with [bits = 15]). The
     allocated window can be re-used by an other inflation/deflation process -
     but it {b can not} be re-used concurrently or cooperatively with another
     inflation/deflation process.

      {b Level.}

      Current implementation of GZIP does not handle any compression level.
     However, the client must give a level between 0 and 9, inclusively,
     Otherwise, we raise an [Invalid_argument].

      {b Metadata.}

      Client is able to store some {i metadata} such as:
      {ul
      {- [mtime] time of last modification of the input.}
      {- [os] {!os} which did the compression.}
      {- [filename] {i filename} of the input (no limitation about length).}
      {- [comment] an arbitrary {i payload} (no limitation about length).}
      {- [ascii] if encoding of contents is ASCII.}
      {- [hcrc] if the client wants a checksum of the GZIP header.}} *)

  (** [dst_rem e] is how many unused bytes remain in the output buffer of [e]. *)

  val src : encoder -> bigstring -> int -> int -> encoder
  (** [src e s j l] provides [e] with [l] bytes to read, starting at [j] in [s].
     This byte range is read by calls to {!encode} with [e] until [`Await] is
     returned. To signal the end of input call the function with [l = 0].

      @raise Invalid_argument when [j] and [l] do not correspond to a valid
     range. *)

  val dst : encoder -> bigstring -> int -> int -> encoder
  (** [dst e s j l] provides [e] with [l] bytes available to write, starting at
     [j] in [s]. This byte range is fill by calls to {!encode} with [e] until
     [`Flush] is returned.

      @raise Invalid_argument when [j] and [l] do not correspond to a valid
     range. *)

  val encode : encoder -> ret
  (** [encode e0] is:

      {ul
      {- [`Await e1] if [e0] has a [`Manual] input source and awaits for more
     input. The client must use {!src} with [e1] to provide it.}
      {- [`Flush e1] if [e0] has a [`Manual] destination and needs more output
     storage. The client must drain the buffer before resuming operation.}
      {- [`End e1] if [e0] encoded all input. Output buffer is possibly not
     empty (it can be check with {!dst_rem}).}}

      {b Limitation.}

      The encoder must manipulate an output buffer of, at least, 2 bytes. If it's
     not the case, [encode] does nothing - and it tells you nothing more than it
     did nothing. Depending on what you do, a loop can infinitely call [encode]
     without any updates until the given output still has less than 2 bytes.

  (** [compress ?level ?filename ?comment ~w ~q ~refill ~flush time cfg i o] compresses
     an input given by [refill] and outputs it via [flush]. It requires:
      - a queue [q] which is shared between the compression algorithm and
        the encoder. The length of it can be a bottleneck on the throughput
      - a {i window} to be able to lookup repeated patterns
      - a {i witness} required by the given [cfg]
      - a {!configuration} value
      - [i] is the input buffer
      - [o] is the output buffer

      When [compress] wants more input, it calls [refill] with [i]. The client
     returns how many bytes he wrotes into [i]. If he returns 0, he signals end
     of input.

      When [compress] has written output buffer, it calls [flush] with [o] and
     how many bytes it wrote. Bytes into [o] must be {b copied} and they will be
     lost at the next call to [flush].

      A simple example of how to use such interface (with [unix]) is:
      {[
        let time () = Int32.of_float (Unix.gettimeofday ())

        let deflate_string ?(level= 4) str =
          let i = De.bigstring_create De.io_buffer_size in
          let o = De.bigstring_create De.io_buffer_size in
          let w = De.Lz77.make_window ~bits:15 in
          let q = De.Queue.create 0x1000 in

          Gz.Higher.compress ~w ~q ~level ~refill ~flush () cfg i o ; Buffer.contents r
      ]}

      As {!De.Higher.compress} or {!Zl.Higher.compress}, [decompress] don't want
     to take the responsability of such function. It's why this function exists
     only as an example. Especially since a GZip compression requires an Unix
     {i syscall} (see [Unix.gettimeofday]) which does not exists on some contexts
     such as MirageOS.

      The speed and the compression ratio depends on the length of the given {i window}
     and the given {!De.Queue.t}. They can be a serious bottleneck on the throughput.
     Due to all of these choices, we show this function as an example - but it should
     not be copied as is! *)

  type metadata = {
      filename: string option

  (** [uncompress ~refill ~flush i o] uncompresses an input given by [refill]
     and outputs it via [flush]. It requires:
      - [i] as the input buffer
      - [o] as the output buffer

      It returns then extracted {i metadata} from the given GZip flow.

      When [uncompress] wants more input, it calls [refill] with [i]. The client
     returns how many bytes he wrote into [i]. If he returns 0, he signals end
     of input.

      When [uncompress] has written output buffer, it calls [flush] with [o] and
     how many bytes it wrote. Bytes into [o] must be {b copied} and tjey will be
     lost at the next call to [flush].

      A simple example of how to use such interface is:
      {[
        let inflate_string str =
          let i = De.bigstring_create De.io_buffer_size in

          | Ok m -> Ok (m, Buffer.contents r)
          | Error _ as err -> err
      ]}

      As {!De.Higher.uncompress} or {!Zl.Higher.uncompress}, [decompress] does not
     want to take the responsability of such implementation when several choices was
     made depending on the context. Indeed, [i] and [o] can be a serious bottleneck
     on the throughput. The choice of [Buffer] can be replaced by something else such
     as a queue or a {i ropes}. All of these choices should be made by the client.
     It's why we provide such function only as an example.
