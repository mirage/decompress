(** {1 ZLIB layer.}

    ZLIB is a standard on top of RFC1951. It uses the {!De} implementation with
   the LZ77 compression algorithm. Module provides non-blocking streaming codec
   to {{:#decode}decode} and {{:#encode}encode} ZLIB encoding. It can
   efficiently work payload by payload without blocking IO. *)

type bigstring =
  (char, Bigarray.int8_unsigned_elt, Bigarray.c_layout) Bigarray.Array1.t

(** {2:decode ZLIB Decoder.}

    Unlike [de], [zl] provides a referentially transparent {!Inf.decoder}. The
   client must use a {!Inf.decoder} given {b by} {!Inf.decode} instead of a
   [decoder] given {b to} {!Inf.decode}. A common use of [zl] is:

     {[
       let rec go d0 = match Inf.decode d0 with
         | `Await d1 -> ... go d1
         | `Flush d1 -> ... go d1
         | _ -> ... in
     ]} *)

  (** The type for decoders. *)

  type src = [ `Channel of in_channel | `String of string | `Manual ]
  (** The type for input sources. With a [`Manual] source the client must

     can safely discard [`Await] case (with [assert false]). *)

  type signal =
    [ `Await of decoder
    | `Flush of decoder
    | `End of decoder
    | `Malformed of string ]

  val decoder : src -> o:bigstring -> allocate:(int -> window) -> decoder
  (** [decoder src ~o ~allocate] is a decoder that inputs from [src].

      {b Output buffer.}

      [zl], as [de], uses [o] buffer as internal buffer to store output. We
     recommend to allocate an {!io_buffer_size} buffer as output buffer. Then,
     {!dst_rem}[ decoder] tells you how many unused bytes remain in [o].

      {b Window.}

      ZLIB has a header to specify the window size needed to inflate a given
     input. When [zl] knows that, it calls [allocate] with a number [bits] so
     that [1 lsl bits] is the size of the window. [bits] can not be larger than 15 nor
     lower than 8. [allocate] can be [fun bits -> De.make_window ~bits] or a
     previously allocated window. [decoder] will take the {i ownership} on it!

      Ownership in our case means that {!decode} will mutate it in-place and expect
     it to remain unchanged between invocations. *)

  val decode : decoder -> signal
  (** [decode d0] is:

      {ul
      {- [`Await d1] if [d0] has a [`Manual] input source and awaits for more
     input. The client must use a {!src} with [d1] to provide it.}
      {- [`Flush d1] if given output buffer [o] (see {!decoder}) needs to be
     drained before work can be resumed. The client must use {!flush} with [d1]
     to {b completely} flush [o]. Usually [o] will be full and consist fully of
     bytes that need to be copied from the buffer, but sometimes only the first
     part of the buffer is used. In those cases {!dst_rem} will give you the
     amount of free/unused bytes remain in [o]. These should {b not} be copied
     since their contents are not part of the output. Instead, the first
     [bigstring_length o - Inf.dst_rem d1] bytes should be copied when flushing
     [o].}

       result. *)
  end
end

(** {2:encode ZLIB Encoder.}

    ZLIB encoder is glue between the LZ77 algorithm and the DEFLATE encoder,
   prefixed with a ZLIB header. Any deal with compression algorithm is not
   possible on this layer (see {!De} for more details). As {!Inf}, and unlike
   {!De}, {!Zl} provides a referentially transparent encoder.

    The client must use the {!Def.encoder} given {b by} {!Def.encode} instead a
   [encoder] given {b to} {!Def.encode}. *)

module Def : sig
  type src = [ `Channel of in_channel | `String of string | `Manual ]
  (** The type for input sources. With a [`Manual] source the client must
     provide input with {!src}. With [`String] or [`Channel] source the client
     can safely discard [`Await] case (with [assert false]). *)

  type dst = [ `Channel of out_channel | `Buffer of Buffer.t | `Manual ]
  (** The type for output destinations. With a [`Manual] destination the client
     must provide output storage with {!dst}. With [`Buffer] or [`Channel]
     destination the client can safely discard [`Flush] case (with [assert false]). *)

  type encoder
  (** The type for ZLIB encoders. *)

  type ret = [ `Await of encoder | `End of encoder | `Flush of encoder ]

  val encoder :
       ?dynamic:bool
    -> q:De.Queue.t
    -> w:De.Lz77.window
    -> level:int
    -> src
    -> dst
    -> encoder
  (** [encoder ~q ~w ~level src dst] is an encoder that inputs from [src] and
     that outputs to [dst].

      {b Internal queue.}

      [encoder] deals internally with compression algorithm and DEFLATE encoder.
     To pass compression values to DEFLATE encoder, we need a queue [q]. Length
     of [q] has an impact on performance, and small lengths can be a bottleneck,
     leading {!encode} to emit many [`Flush]. We recommend a queue as large as
     output buffer.

      {b Window.}

      ZLIB is able to constrain length of window used to do LZ77 compression.
     However, small window can slow-down LZ77 compression algorithm. Small
     windows are mostly used to enable inflation of output in memory-constrained
     environments, for example when compressed data from untrusted sources must
     be processed.

      {b Level.}

      Zlib implements 10 levels (from 0 to 9). All of them use the dynamic &
     canonic huffman if [dynamic] is [true] (default). Otherwise, we use the
     static huffman. The higher the level, the better the ratio. *)

  val src_rem : encoder -> int
  (** [src_rem e] is how many bytes it remains in given input buffer. *)

  val dst_rem : encoder -> int
  (** [dst_rem e] is how many unused bytes remain in the output buffer of [e]. *)

  val src : encoder -> bigstring -> int -> int -> encoder
  (** [src e s j l] provides [e] with [l] bytes to read, starting at [j] in [s].
     This byte range is read by calls to {!encode} with [e] until [`Await] is
     returned. To signal the end of input call the function with [l = 0].

     @raise Invalid_argument when [j] and [l] do not correspond to a valid
     range. *)

  val dst : encoder -> bigstring -> int -> int -> encoder
  (** [dst e s j l] provides [e] with [l] bytes available to write, starting at
     [j] in [s]. This byte range is fill by calls to {!encode} with [e] until
     [`Flush] is returned.

     @raise Invalid_argument when [j] and [l] do not correspond to a valid
     range. *)

  val encode : encoder -> ret
  (** [encode e0] is:

      {ul
      {- [`Await e1] if [e0] has a [`Manual] input source and awaits for more
     input. The client must use {!src} with [e1] to provide it.}
      {- [`Flush e1] if [e0] has a [`Manual] destination and needs more output
     storage. The client must drain the buffer before resuming operation.}
      {- [`End e1] if [e1] encoded all input. Output buffer is possibly not
     empty (it can be check with {!dst_rem}).}}

      {b Limitation.}

      The encoder must manipulate an output buffer of, at least, 2 bytes. If it's
     not the case, [encode] does nothing - and it tells you nothing more than it
     did nothing. Depending on what you do, a loop can infinitely call [encode]
     without any updates until the given output still has less than 2 bytes.
   *)

  module Ns : sig
    type error = De.Def.Ns.error
    (** The type for deflation errors. *)

    val pp_error : Format.formatter -> error -> unit
    (** Pretty-printer for {!error}. *)

    val compress_bound : int -> int
    (** [compress_bound len] returns a {i clue} about how many bytes we need
       to store the result of the deflation of [len] bytes. It's a
       pessimistic calculation. *)

    val deflate :
      ?level:int -> bigstring -> bigstring -> (int, [> error ]) result
    (** [deflate ~level src dst] deflates the content of [src] into [dst].

        In case of success, it returns the bytes writen in an [Ok] result. In case
       of failure, it returns the error in an [Error] result. {!compress_bound}
       can be used to {i determine} how many bytes the user needs to allocate
       as the destination buffer when he wants to compress [N] bytes.

        Here is an example of how to compress any inputs:
        {[
          val input : bigstring

          let len = Zl.Def.Ns.compress_bound (De.bigstring_length input) in
          let dst = De.bigstring_create len in
          Zl.Def.Ns.deflate ~level:4 input dst
        ]} *)
  end
end

module Higher : sig
  val compress :
       ?level:int
    -> ?dynamic:bool
    -> w:De.Lz77.window
    -> q:De.Queue.t
    -> refill:(bigstring -> int)
    -> flush:(bigstring -> int -> unit)
    -> bigstring

    -> unit
  (** [compress ?level ?dynamic ~w ~q ~refill ~flush i o] is [Zlib.compress]
     (with [~header:true]) provided by [camlzip] package.

      {ul
      {- [w] is the window used by LZ77 compression algorithm.}
      {- [q] is shared-queue between compression algorithm and DEFLATE encoder.}
      {- [i] is input buffer.}
      {- [o] is output buffer.}}

      When [compress] wants more input, it calls [refill] with [i]. The client
     returns how many bytes he wrote into [i]. If he returns 0, he signals end
     of input.

      When [compress] has written output buffer, it calls [flush] with [o] and
     how many bytes it wrote. Bytes into [o] must be {b copied} and they will be
     lost at the next call to [flush].

      A simple example of how to use such interface is:
      {[
        let deflate_string ?(level= 4) str =
          let i = De.bigstring_create De.io_buffer_size in
          let o = De.bigstring_create De.io_buffer_size in
          let w = De.Lz77.make_window ~bits:15 in
          let q = De.Queue.create 0x1000 in
          let r = Buffer.create 0x1000 in
          let p = ref 0 in
          let refill buf =
            let len = min (String.length str - !p) De.io_buffer_size in
            Bigstringaf.blit_from_string str ~src_off:!p buf ~dst_off:0 ~len ;
            p := !p + len ; len in
          let flush buf len =
            let str = Bigstringaf.substring buf ~off:0 ~len in
            Buffer.add_string r str in
          Zl.Higher.compress ~level ~dynamic:true
            ~w ~q ~refill ~flush i o ;
          Buffer.contents r
      ]}

      As {!De.Higher.compress}, several choices was made in this code and
     [decompress] don't want to be responsible of them. It's why such function
     exists only as example when lengths of buffers (such as [i], [o] or [q])
     changes the speed/compression ratio/memory consumption.
  *)

  val uncompress :
       allocate:(int -> window)

      {ul
      {- [allocate] is the allocator of window used by LZ77 uncompression algorithm}
      {- [i] is input buffer.}
      {- [o] is output buffer.}}

      When [uncompress] wants more input, it calls [refill] with [i]. The client
     returns how many bytes he wrote into [i]. If he returns 0, he signals end
     of input.

      When [uncompress] has written output buffer, it calls [flush] with [o] and
     how many bytes it wrote. Bytes into [o] must be {b copied} and they will be
     lost at the next call to [flush].

      A simple example of how to use such interface is:
      {[
        let inflate_string str =
          let i = De.bigstring_create De.io_buffer_size in
          let o = De.bigstring_create De.io_buffer_size in
          let allocate bits = De.make_window ~bits in
          let r = Buffer.create 0x1000 in
          let p = ref 0 in
          let refill buf =
            let len = min (String.length str - !p) De.io_buffer_size in
            Bigstringaf.blit_from_string str ~src_off:!p buf ~dst_off:0 ~len ;
            p := !p + len ; len in

          | Ok () -> Ok (Buffer.contents r)
          | Error _ as err -> err
      ]}

      As you can see, several allocations appear. As long as you want to
     uncompress several contents for example, you can re-use the same {i window}
     instead of an allocation of one per uncompression. Then, the throughput is
     mostly limited by [i] and [o] (even bigger, even faster but it requires
     memories). [decompress] don't want to be responsible about these choices,
     it's why such function exists only as an example. *)
