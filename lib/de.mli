(** {1 RFC1951/DEFLATE codec.}

    RFC1951/DEFLATE is a IETF standard. Module provides non-blocking streaming
   codec to {{:#decode}decode} and {{:#encode}encode} DEFLATE encoding. It can
   efficiently work payload by payload without blocking IO.

    Module provides {{:#compression}LZ77 compression} algorithm but lets the
   client to define his algorithm as long as he/she uses shared queue provided
   in this module.

    {1 Lz77 compression and huffman compression.}

    [Lz77] does a compression such as it searches a repeated {i pattern} and
   emits a [Copy] code (see {!type:Queue.cmd}) which tells us to copy a
   previous pattern. For instance, this is an equivalence between a list
   of {!type:Queue.cmd}s and a [string].

    {[
      let cmds = [ `Literal 'a'; `Copy (1, 3) ]
      let results = "aaaa"
    ]}

     The goal of [Lz77] is to produce such list from a [string] to help then
    a format such as [DEFLATE] to compress inputs.

     [Def] does an huffman compression. From a list of {!type:Queue.cmd}, it
    can calculate frequencies (see {!type:literals} and {!type:distances}) and
    generate a smaller representation of the given {i alphabet}. Such
    compression is available {i via} the {!const:Def.Fixed} or the
    {!const:Def.Dynamic} block. The {!const:Def.Flat} block does a copy of any
    literals into the output.

     {b NOTE}: It's illegal to emit a [`Copy] {!type:Queue.cmd} and try to
    serialize it with a {!const:Def.Flat} block. {!Queue.eob} is {b required}
    for {!const:Def.Fixed} and {!const:Def.Dynamic} (to delimit the end of the
    block) and ignored by the {!const:Def.Flat} block. *)

(** {2 Prelude.}

    [de] wants to be self-contained. By this constraint, it provides convenience
   values to be used by others (like [zl]). The client should not use these
   functions even if they are available. Others libraries like [Bigstringaf]
   serve the same purpose of a much better way. *)

(** {2 Queue.}

    DEFLATE encoder needs a compressed input which can be transmited by a shared
   queue filled by compression algorithm. {!B} is used between {!N} and a
   compression algorithm like {!L}. It provides a small representation of
   commands (see {!Queue.cmd}) emitted by compression algorithm.

    {!N} encoder interprets {!Queue.cmd} as fast as it can. Shared queue can be a
   bottleneck about the whole compression process. Indeed, it limits encoder on
   how many bytes it can produce. We recommend to make a queue as large as
   output buffer. *)

     how many bytes it wrote. Bytes into [o] must be {b copied} and they will be
     lost at the next call to [flush].

      A simple example of how to use such interface is:

          let i = De.bigstring_create De.io_buffer_size in

            let str = Bigstringaf.substring buf ~off:0 ~len in
            Buffer.add_string r str in
          De.Higher.compress ~w ~q ~refill ~flush i o ; Buffer.contents r
      ]}

      As you can see, we allocate several things such as input and output buffers.
     Such choice should be decided by the end-user - and it's why we don't provide
     such function. The speed or the compression ratio depends on the length of:
      - [q] which is shared between the compression algorithm and the encoder
      - [i] which is the input buffer (and allows a large {i lookup} or not)
      - [o] which is the output buffer (it can be a bottle-neck for the throughput)
      - [w] which is the {i lookup-window}
      - [r] which is the data-structure to save the output (it can be a buffer,
        a queue, a [out_channel], etc.)

      As we said, several choices depends on what you want and your context. We
     deliberately choose to be not responsible on these choices. It's why such
     function exists only as an example - and it's not a part of the distribution. *)

      When [compress] has written output buffer, it calls [flush] with [o] and
     how many bytes it wrote. Bytes into [o] must be {b copied} and they will be
     lost at the next call to [flush].

      A simple example of how to use such interface is:
      {[
        let inflate_string str =
          let i = De.bigstring_create De.io_buffer_size in
          let o = De.bigstring_create De.io_buffer_size in
          let w = De.make_window ~bits:15 in
          let r = Buffer.create 0x1000 in
          let p = ref 0 in
          let refill buf =
            let len = min (String.length str - !p) De.io_buffer_size in
            Bigstringaf.blit_from_String str ~src_off:!p buf ~dst_off:0 ~len ;
            p := !p + len ; len in
          let flush buf len =
            let str = Bigstringaf.substring buf ~off:0 ~len in
            Buffer.add_string r buf in
          match De.Higher.uncompress ~w ~refill ~flush i o with
          | Ok () -> Ok (Buffer.contents r)
          | Error _ as err -> err
      ]}

      As you can see, we allocate several things such as input and output buffers.
     As {!compress}, these details should be decided by the end-user. The speed of
     the decompression depends on the length of:
      - [i] which is the input buffer (it can a bottle-neck for the throughput)
      - [o] which is the output buffer (it can be a bottle-neck for the throughput)

      The {i window} depends on how you deflated/compressed the input. Usually, we
     allow a {i window} of 15 bits.
